Our project is pretty simple so far, the only thing you need to do to get our project going is:

Please cd into our project folder once you are done uncompressing it.

$ cd MBTA_App

Now simply type the following:

$ make test

Once the application is running, simply press the "Fetch Train Data" button located at the bottom of the application window.
